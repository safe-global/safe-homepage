Unlike its competitor Bitcoin, Ethereum is designed as a whole network, hosting other applications as well as financial services. In <a href='https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>their own words</a>, Ethereum users have gone from being companies, developers and investors to also including artists, musicians, writers and gamers.</p><p>First introduced in 2015, this technology has undergone multiple upgrades since its inception, with each aiming to improve the user experience, security or other significant features of the platform. The next scheduled update is the Pectra upgrade, consisting of the Prague (execution layer) and Electra (consensus layer) changes. There&#39;s no fixed date for this release, but experts suggest that Ethereum users can anticipate the changes in Q4 2024 or Q1 2025, which has increased industry talk about what we might expect to see in this rollout.</p><p>In this guide, we take you through historic changes to Ethereum, what we might be able to expect from the Pectra upgrade, and what blockchain could look like in the future.</p>",
