        The Safe Ecosystem Foundation, Bahnhofstrasse 16, 6300 Zug, Switzerland (&quot;<b>SEF</b>&quot; also referred to
        as &quot;
        <b>Trademark Owner</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>we</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>our</b>&quot;) is the owner of various trademarks.
        To ensure the integrity and protection of the <b>Safe Trademarks</b> (as defined below), to regulate the use of
        the Safe Trademarks, and to protect users, SEF has defined this trademark policy (&quot;
        <b>Policy</b>&quot;). This Policy sets out the general conditions and requirements under which the Safe
        Trademarks may be used. This Policy does not provide or amend any licenses applicable to technology published by
        SEF. Projects operating as separately incorporated entities within the Safe ecosystem may have their own
        trademark policies.

      <i>We thank you for your cooperation in complying with this Policy.</i>
    </p>

    <h3>1.&emsp;Purpose and Scope of Application</h3>

    <p>This Policy covers all of our trademarks, whether they are registered or not, including, among others:</p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      This Policy outlines Safe project&apos;s (the &quot;<b>Project</b>&quot;) Policy for the use of our Safe
      Trademarks. While our Safe technology source code is available under a free and open source software copyright
      license, the copyright licence does not include an express or implied right or licence to use the Safe Trademarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this Policy is not intended to limit the lawful use of our Safe Trademarks. The purpose of this
      Policy is to prevent confusion amongst the Safe community (and public at large) as to what we deem an appropriate
      use of our Safe Trademarks and limit any misleading or damaging use of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this Policy, we reserve the right to withdraw any permission and/or amend, challenge or restrict
      any use of our Safe Trademarks where we consider that such use amounts to a violation of this Policy or any use
      that we view as detrimental to the Project.
    </p>
    <p>This Policy applies to all parties intending to use or using the Safe Trademarks.</p>

    <h3>3.&emsp;General Considerations & Rules Applicable for Safe Trademark Use</h3>

    <p>
      Whenever you use one of the Safe Trademarks, you must always do so in a way that does not mislead anyone, either
      directly or by omission, about exactly what they are getting and from whom. The law reflects this requirement in
      two major ways described in more detail below: it prohibits creating a &quot;likelihood of confusion&quot; but
      allows for &quot;nominative use&quot;. For example, you cannot say you are distributing the Safe technology
      software code (the &quot;
      <b>Safe Code</b>&quot;) when you&apos;re distributing a modified version of it, as this could confuse users who
      might expect the same features and functionality they would get if they downloaded the software directly from the
      Safe Project. On the other hand, you may use our Safe Trademarks for non-commercial purposes to indicate that your
      product or service is compatible and/or builds on the Safe Code.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also cannot use our Safe Trademarks on your website in a way that suggests that your website is an official
      website of the Safe Project unless this is true and you are a licensed partner of Safe Project. You can, though,
      say you like the Safe Code, that you participate in the Safe community and ecosystem, that you are providing an
      unmodified version of the Safe Code.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fundamental requirement, that it is always clear to people what they are getting and from whom, is reflected
      throughout this Policy. It should also serve as your guide if you are not sure about how you are using the Safe
      Trademarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following rules apply for the Informative Trademark and Non Commercial Use as defined in the definition
      section above. The rules also apply to any kind of Commercial Use, but any Commercial Use of the Safe Trademarks
      is subject to prior written consent of the Trademark Owner as per section 4.2 and subject to a specific licensing
      contract with the Trademark Owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the guiding principles of the SEF is Open Source. SEF both hopes and encourages external parties to share
      knowledge related to technology developed and published by SEF, including SAFE{'{CORE}'} and SAFE{'{WALLET}'}{' '}
      (&quot;<b>Safe Technology</b>&quot;). It also advocates the promotion of the Safe Trademarks used for products
      built using Safe Technology. Therefore, contributors to and participants in the Safe ecosystem should be able to
      use our Safe Trademarks to promote their Safe projects even beyond the right to fair use.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we have to keep in mind that the <b>incorrect</b> use of a brand may lead to a dilution of the Safe
      Trademark and, thus, to impairment due to a lack of differentiation from other brands. Therefore, SEF established
      the following rules for the use of Safe Trademarks. SEF requires you to follow these guidelines to properly use
      the Safe Trademarks to help maintain the value of our Safe Trademarks.
    </p>

    <h4>3.1.&emsp;Our Six Rules for the Acceptable Use of Safe Trademarks</h4>

    <p>
      If you want to use the Safe Trademarks for Non-Commercial and/or Informative Trademark Use, you don&apos;t require
      SEF&apos;s explicit prior permission and/or a license agreement as long as you follow the following rules. We
      reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to alter and amend these rules, to determine when these rules are
      adhered to or violated, and to choose appropriate enforcement measures.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Rule #1:
      <br />
      Acceptance of this Policy
    </h5>

    <p>Any use of the Safe Trademarks indicates acceptance of this Policy.</p>

    <h5>
      Rule #2:
      <br />
      The Ecosystem Rule
    </h5>

    <p>
      Refer to Safe and/or use the Safe Trademark and logo only when promoting products, projects, or events based on
      and/or about Safe Technology, including SAFE{'{CORE}'} and SAFE{'{WALLET}'} and in accordance with the disclaimer
      below. Use of the Safe Trademarks when referring to other software or technologies, would be misleading to the
      audience, as well as damaging to the Safe Trademarks and Safe ecosystem. Therefore, Safe Trademarks must not be
      used when referring to software based on protocols by other entities / projects and / or in another misleading or
      unfair manner. Any use of the Safe Trademarks in these contexts could potentially subject you to liability for
      trademark infringement, false advertising, and unfair competition.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Rule #3:
      <br />
      Use your Brand and add Safe as an Ingredient Brand
    </h5>

    <p>
      It must be clear who the owner and/or marketer of the promoted product, service, project, or event is. Use the
      Safe Trademarks only as a reference. There must be no potential for confusion or misunderstanding as to such that
      the product, service, project, or event is manufactured, marketed, sponsored, endorsed, or authorized by SEF, when
      in fact, that is not the case. Your name, brand, or trademark must not be less prominent than the Safe Trademarks,
      and Safe must not be the only visible name, brand, or trademark on your online/offline communication. To make it
      clear for your audience or users that Safe Technology such as SAFE{'{CORE}'} and SAFE
      {'{WALLET}'} is used for your project use wording such as, for example, &quot;<b>powered by Safe</b>&quot; or
      &quot;<b>powered by SAFE{'{CORE}'}</b>&quot;.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are promoting a strictly non-profit and free-entry event regarding Safe Technology, SAFE{'{CORE}'} and/or
      SAFE
      {'{WALLET}'}, you may use the Safe Trademarks as a primary brand for the event title.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Rule #4:
      <br />
      Use Safe Trademarks according to our Brand Guidelines
    </h5>

    <p>
      Use the word Safe and/or SAFE{'{CORE}'} and/or SAFE{'{WALLET}'} in the same font and size as the surrounding text.
      For the logo etc. please refer to our brand kit{' '}
      <a href={SAFE_MEDIA_KIT_LINK} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
        Safe Media Kit (notion.site)
      </a>{' '}
      and use it solely as stated in the brand kit of SEF.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Rule #5:
      <br />
      Integrity of the Safe Trademarks and Recognition Notice
    </h5>

    <p>
      Do not incorporate the Safe Trademarks and/or any recognizable part of them into other logos, brand names, company
      names, domain names, or product names. Always make it clear that SEF legally owns the Safe Trademarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are referring to a Safe Trademark, add the following brand recognition notice at a suitable location, such
      as on your product, in print material or online:
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;
      <i>
        SAFE{'{CORE}'}Â® and SAFE{'{WALLET}'}Â®, and the Safe logos are trademarks or registered trademarks of Safe
        Ecosystem Foundation
      </i>
      &quot;
    </p>

    <h5>
      Rule #6:
      <br />

    </h5>

    <p>
      These partners operate their implementations of Safe{'{Wallet}'} under their own name and responsibility, without
      any involvement or liability assumed by the SEF and/or the License Management Company. While the SEF and/or the
      License Management Company do not operate any implementations of Safe{'{Wallet}'}, Safe{'{Wallet}'} Partners may
      obtain licenses for the Safe Trademarks enabling them to use the &quot;Safe{'{Wallet}'}&quot; name and logo in
      accordance with this Policy and a respective license agreement.
    </p>
    <p>

      provided or made available by the SEF and/or the License Management Company in any capacity. Therefore, by using,
      interacting with, or implementing the Safe Technology or any of its related components, you are{' '}
      <b>
        <u>NOT</u>
      </b>{' '}
      interacting with the SEF and/or the License Management Company in any way.
    </p>
