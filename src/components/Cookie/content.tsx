          <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
          <p>
            Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer or device
            used to access a website. A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile
            device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as
            login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don&apos;t have to
            keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.

          <h3>What are the different types of cookies?</h3>
          <p>A cookie can be classified by its lifespan and the domain to which it belongs.</p>
          <p>By lifespan, a cookie is either a:</p>
          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'circle' }}>
            <li>
              <strong>session cookie</strong> which is erased when the user closes the browser; or
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>persistent cookie</strong> which is saved to the hard drive and remains on the user&apos;s
              computer/device for a pre-defined period of time. As for the domain to which it belongs, cookies are
              either:
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>first-party cookies</strong> which are set by the web server of the visited page and share the
              same domain (i.e. set by us); or
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>third-party cookies</strong> stored by a different domain to the visited page&apos;s domain.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>What cookies do we use and why?</h3>
          <p>We list all the cookies we use on this website in the APPENDIX below.</p>
          <p>
            We do not use cookies set by ourselves via our web developers (first-party cookies). We only have those set
            by others (third-party cookies).
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies are also sometimes classified by reference to their purpose. We use the following cookies for the
            following purposes:
          </p>
          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'circle' }}>
            <li>
              Analytical/performance cookies: They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how
              visitors move around our website when they are using it, as well as dates and times they visit. This helps
              us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are
              looking for easily.
            </li>

              Targeting cookies: These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the
              links you have followed, as well as time spent on our website, and the websites visited just before and
              just after our website. We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed on
              it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this
              purpose.

            (‘aggregated’) and provides general and not individually specific information. None of this information is
            therefore associated with you as an individual and the cookie-related information is not used to identify
            you personally. It is therefore anonymized and ‘de-identified’. The pattern data is fully under our control
            and these cookies are not used for any purpose other than those described here.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will retain and evaluate information on your recent visits to our website and how you move around
            different sections of our website for analytics purposes to understand how people use our website so that we
            can make it more intuitive. The information also helps us to understand which parts of this website are most
            popular and generally to assess user behaviour and characteristics to measure interest in and use of the
            various areas of our website. This then allows us to improve our website and the way we market our business.
          </p>
          <p>
            This information may also be used to help us to improve, administer and diagnose problems with our server
            and website. The information also helps us monitor traffic on our website so that we can manage our
            website&apos;s capacity and efficiency.

          <h3>Other Technologies</h3>
          <p>
            We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf. In addition to the
            uses of cookies described above, these entities may use other methods, such as the technologies described
            below, to collect information about your use of our website and other websites and online services.

          <h3>Google Analytics Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            This website uses <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, a web analytics service
            provided by Google, Inc. (&quot;Google&quot;).
          </p>
          <p>
            We use Google Analytics to track your preferences and also to identify popular sections of our website. Use
            of Google Analytics in this way, enables us to adapt the content of our website more specifically to your
            needs and thereby improve what we can offer to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our website, compiling reports on
            website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and
            internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law,
            or where such third parties process the information on Google&apos;s behalf. Google will not associate your
            IP address with any other data held by Google.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>In particular Google Analytics tells us</strong>
          </p>
          <ol style={{ listStyleType: 'circle' }}>
            <li>your IP address (last 3 digits are masked);</li>
            <li>the number of pages visited;</li>
            <li>the time and duration of the visit;</li>
            <li>your location;</li>
            <li>the website you came from (if any);</li>
            <li>the type of hardware you use (i.e. whether you are browsing from a desktop or a mobile device);</li>
            <li>the software used (type of browser); and</li>
            <li>your general interaction with our website.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            As stated above, cookie-related information is not used to identify you personally, and what is compiled is
            only aggregate data that tells us, for example, what countries we are most popular in, but not that you live
            in a particular country or your precise location when you visited our website (this is because we have only
            half the information- we know the country the person is browsing from, but not the name of person who is
            browsing). In such an example Google will analyze the number of users for us, but the relevant cookies do
            not reveal their identities.
